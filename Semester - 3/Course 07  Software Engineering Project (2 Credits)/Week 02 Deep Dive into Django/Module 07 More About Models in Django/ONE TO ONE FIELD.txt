ONE TO ONE FIELD

Syntax: OneToOneField(to, on_delete, parent_link=False, **options)

1. to(required): specifies the related model as the first positional argument. It should be a reference to the related model class. 
2. on_delete(required): This paramter specifies what should happen when the referenced object is deleted. (github)
	- models.CASCADE: Deletes the object that has the OneToOneField when the referenced object is deleted.
	- models.PROTECT: Prevents deletion of the referenced object by raising a ProtectedError.
	- models.SET_NULL: Sets the OneToOneField to NULL when the referenced object is deleted.
	- models.SET_DEFAULT: Sets the OneToOneField to its default value when the referenced object is deleted
	- models.SET(): Sets the OneToOneField to the value passed as an argument when the referenced object is deleted. 
	- models.SET_ON_DELETE: Sets the OneToOneField to the value of the field's on_delete attribute when the referenced object is deleted.
	- models.DO_NOTHING: Takes no action when the referenced object is deleted. It assumes that you handle the situation manually (rarely used).

Parameter Names:

1. related_name: This paramter allows you to specify the reverse relation from the related model back to the model with the OneToOneField. It defines the name to use for the reverse relation. If not provided, Django automatically generates a default name based on the name of the model.
2. related_query_name: This parameter specifies the name to use for the reverse relation's query name. It is used in the case of a related model being referenced in a query.
3. db_constraint: When set to True, this parameter enforces a database-level constraint to ensure the uniqueness of the relationship. It creates a foreign key constraint in the database.
4. unique: When set to True, this parameter ensures that the relationship is unique. Only one instance of the related model can be associated with a specific instance of the model containing the OneToOneField.
5. null: When set to True, this parameter allows the OneToOneField to be set to NULL if the related object is not provided. By default, it is set to False, and a related object must be specified.
